# A-Real-Time-Face-Detection-Using-OpenCV
A real time face detection code using OpenCV library in Python. The real time face detection was tested using the same code but with a picture as an input. Also, the classifier used to detect the face (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) was obtained from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data. 

## The Real Time Face Detection
  1. Download a Python IDE (Anaconda-Spyder was used).
  2. Install OpenCV by opening Anaconda prompt and enter the following command:
  ```
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
  3. Save the included files in the repository.
  4. Run the code (Real_Time_Face_Detection.py).

## The Picture Face Detection Used For Testing
  1. Run the code (Real_Time_Face_Detection.py).
  2. The following image should be produced:
